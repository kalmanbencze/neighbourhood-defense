# NEIGHBOURHOOD DEFENSE

This is a small Augmented reality game that I have worked on in 2014.
It uses libGDX engine and models created by me in Blender. The particle system is implemented using libGDX.

The app uses the phone's sensors to calculate the rotation the device is oriented (TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR or TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR). Then the rotation is mapped to the game engines coordinate system, and the player camera is rotated accordingly.

NOTE:The code is outdated, the target sdk has been updated to 26 but the app will crash (for now) if the camera permission is not granted.
